I have always wanted to be a detective and have finally succeeded.  
As a small child I was determined to become an archeologist and learn the secrets of the mummies at the Museum of Natural History.  
But when I read Paul de Kruif's The Microbe Hunters (1927) in junior high school, 
I realized that my true calling was not in archeology but in bacteriology.  
Microscopic mummies were more challenging and held secrets of greater consequence.  
I was no fickle child, however.  
The archeologist urge remained for six years; the bacteriologist aspiration stayed with me for another five.  
Until my college years they were the only careers I considered.  I had the good fortune to attend the Bronx High School of Science where 
I studied the subject that had, long before, brought fame to Koch, Pasteur, Lister, and others.  But it wasnâ€™t fame I craved; 
it was the thrill of discovery.  
Truths were hidden under the microscope and I was going to find them.
